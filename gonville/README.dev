The present modification only generates a few symbols.
- Run "python3 glyphs.py --lilymain" for generation the
  font files.
- script.ff is used to scale all fonts by a given factor
  and then generating a font file with fontforge.
  (it is called within glyphs.py)
- The glyphs to be generated must be mentioned in the long
  list in glyphs.py.
- The defiition of the glyphs can be found in font.py

---- What comes is the original readme -------

Developer README for Gonville
=============================

This directory contains Gonville, a font of musical symbols drawn by
Simon Tatham and usable as a drop-in replacement for GNU Lilypond's
default symbol set.

The source form of the font is entirely in Python. Glyph definitions
in the form of Python source code can be found in glyphs.py. Running
that program with the appropriate option (usually '-lily', but see
below) causes a complicated build process to take place:

 - Each glyph is converted from the Python description into a piece
   of PostScript which draws it at reasonable resolution. This
   PostScript is constructed by generating a large but finite number
   of points along each curve, so if rendered at _sufficient_
   resolution (without increasing that number) it will show a loss
   of quality.

 - The PostScript is fed to Ghostscript to generate a large
   black-and-white bitmap of the glyph.

 - That bitmap is in turn fed to 'potrace' to convert it into an
   outline description in terms of Bezier curves, which is then
   recovered by glyphs.py and translated into a set of .sfd files.

 - Finally, the .sfd files are processed by Fontforge to convert
   them into the various standard font file formats required by
   Lilypond.

The reason for doing it this way is that the glyph descriptions in
glyphs.py are very little like the sort of outline that font formats
want. Instead of defining the outline of the filled area of the
glyph, the descriptions typically work by defining the _centre_ line
of the glyph and then specifying a line thickness or a chisel nib
(which often vary continuously along the line).

This is a rather hurriedly written README; I'm not really expecting
it to be comprehensible to somebody who isn't also competent to read
the Python source code to fill in the gaps. Sorry about that. If
anyone needs to understand it and can't, please ask more questions,
and I'll try to improve this file based on the resulting
conversation.

Generating the font files
-------------------------

To generate the full Gonville font in a Lilypond-ready form, run

  ./glyphs.py -lily

This takes about half an hour on my 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo, of which two
minutes are spent generating the main glyph set and the rest of the
time is devoted to generating the subtly varying brace characters at
576 different sizes. During development of the former, therefore, it
is often useful to use '-lilymain' instead of '-lily', which only
regenerates the main part of the font containing everything except
the braces. You can also specify '-lilybrace' to regenerate just the
braces, for completeness.

All of these options will leave a directory called 'lilyfonts' in
the current working directory, containing all the output font files.
There will also be a large number of .sfd, .LILC, .LILF and .LILY
files left lying around.

Other modes of glyphs.py
------------------------

Other command-line modes in which glyphs.py can be run include:

./glyphs.py -test <symbol>

  This generates the PostScript code to draw a given glyph, just as
  described above, and then writes it on standard output. It's
  useful when actually designing a glyph: you can edit the source,
  run the test mode and view the result, then edit again if you
  don't like it. A comment in glyphs.py gives a sample command line
  which automatically pipes the output of this mode through
  Ghostscript to produce a .png of the glyph.

./glyphs.py -testps <symbol>

  This runs a bit more of the build process for a given glyph:
  instead of stopping at the original PostScript drawing code, this
  mode goes through the subsequent potrace step and generates the
  final Bezier-based outline. Then it outputs that on standard
  output in simple Postscript, so you can examine the results of the
  tracing step.

Note that the '<symbol>' placeholder in the above lines refers to
the glyph names _as defined in the source code_, not the ones used
in the output file for compatibility with Lilypond. Hence, for
instance, 'clefG' instead of 'clefs.G', and 'taildemidn' instead of
'flags.d5'.

There is also '-testpsunscaled', which is just like '-testps' except
that it omits the final scaling of the outline to the final font
coordinate system (in which each character is given a sensible
origin point, and the distance between adjacent stave lines is 250
font units), and instead keeps the coordinates exactly as they
appear in the output of potrace.

(Finally, '-mus' generates a version of this font suitable for use
in my personal music typesetting software. I don't recommend using
that; it was something I wrote when I was very young and from which
I have now migrated to using Lilypond. I don't intend to maintain
it.)

Drawing glyphs
--------------

I didn't draw all these glyphs by hand-typing the coordinates of the
line and curve segments, of course. The provided 'gui.py' is a
simple Python/TK user interface for editing the curve sets by
dragging endpoints around in a reasonably normal sort of way.

However, it's a pretty hacky program; I didn't want to spend the
time on writing a full GUI which I could be spending on actually
drawing the font. A brief description of how it works follows.

When gui.py starts up, it displays a blank window. You can then:

 - Create new curve segments by hovering the mouse over that window
   and pressing 'i', 'l' or 'b'. This will instantiate a new curve
   of the appropriate type (see below for the curve types) with
   default parameters, and place it roughly under where the mouse
   pointer was.

 - Drag to adjust endpoints and control points of existing curve
   segments. Drag the endpoints in the obvious way; the curves that
   are not straight lines will also show green (or red - see below)
   lines sticking out of the endpoints, which you can drag to adjust
   the curve's directional behaviour at that endpoint.

 - To weld two curve ends together, so that they are constrained to
   end at the same place and point in the same direction, drag the
   two ends to roughly the same place, then hover the mouse over
   that spot and press 'w'.

 - To remove a weld, hover the mouse over the welded endpoints and
   press 'u'.

 - To save the curve data you have drawn, press 'S'. The program
   does not bother writing data to files; instead it will write a
   fragment of Python on its standard output, suitable for pasting
   into glyphs.py at the default four-space indent.

 - To load curve data back in for adjustment, press 'L'. The program
   will then expect you to paste a block of curve data into its
   standard input, and will display that block in the GUI window so
   you can edit and re-save it. It will keep reading from standard
   input until it sees a line beginning with "# End" (with optional
   leading whitespace), so it's easiest if you keep the line of that
   type which 'S' generates.

 - To apply an affine transformation to the current set of curves,
   hit 'T' or Ctrl-T. The program will prompt you to enter a matrix
   on its standard input, which should be specified in Python syntax
   as a list (or tuple) of six values, interpreted as a PostScript
   matrix. (That is, [a,b,c,d,e,f] represents the transformation in
   which (x,y) is mapped to (ax+cy+e, bx+dy+f).) Note that
   y-coordinates in the GUI window go from the top downwards. 'T'
   and Ctrl-T differ in that the latter will create squashed
   involutes (see below), whereas the former will just transform
   their endpoints and directions and let the curve shape alter
   subtly (which is sometimes what I wanted).

 - Anything else, you're on your own. The GUI has no method for
   deleting curves, for reordering them so that their Python
   identifiers change, or for specifying the various special
   features supported by the underlying curve system. To do any of
   those things, you have to save the curve set out using 'S', edit
   the resulting Python code manually, and paste it back in using
   'L'. (Again, I didn't want to spend lots of time polishing the
   editor if I could manage with a very basic program and have more
   time to draw glyphs.)

 - Press Ctrl-Q to quit gui.py.

Curve types:

 - 'l' is a straight line, defined by its two endpoints.

 - 'b' is a cubic Bezier curve, defined by two endpoints and two
   control arms. Each control arm governs the direction of the curve
   at the endpoint it connects to, and its length specifies the
   'velocity' of the curve, or how far it goes in that direction
   before heading off towards its other endpoint.

 - 'i' is a segment of an involute of a circle, which is the main
   curve type used for most of the Gonville glyphs. These just
   specify two endpoints and two directions. For some settings of
   these parameters, the formulae used to choose the output curve
   will pick one that has a cusp somewhere along its length; this is
   obvious in most cases, but in subtle cases (where it _only just_
   happens) the cusp will be near one end and hard to spot. To warn
   you of this, the control arms will turn from green to red in this
   situation.

 - 'e' is a segment of an involute of an exponential decay curve. I
   introduced this for one specific purpose, which was to join the
   curve at the bottom of the treble clef to the straight line down
   its middle: the involute of a curve that asymptotes to the x-axis
   attains zero curvature when it meets the axis itself, because the
   radius of curvature tends to infinity. So this permits a
   reasonably smooth join between a straight line and a curve.

Special features you can access by manually editing the curve
definitions:

 - Half-welds are a means of joining two curve ends together so they
   are constrained to end at the same point but are _not_
   constrained to go in the same direction, so you can specify a
   sharp corner. To create a half-weld, edit the 'weld_to' command
   in the saved curve set code to add the extra parameter '1' at the
   end. There are plenty of examples of this in the current code.

 - 'Special' welds constrain two curve endpoints in a more complex
   way than just making them terminate in the same place. To create
   a special weld, add the half-weld parameter as above (setting it
   to 0 if you don't want a half-weld), and follow it with a tuple
   of four numbers. This constrains the two curve ends to be
   separated by distance t[0] in the x-direction, plus t[1] in the
   y-direction, plus t[2] in the direction of the curve at the
   endpoint, plus t[3] normal to the direction of the curve. At the
   time of writing there currently aren't any examples of this in
   use - I wrote it for a glyph which I subsequently found a better
   way to draw without using this feature.

 - Squashed circle involutes are useful for using the involute curve
   type (which is good at circle-like curves) to draw essentially
   squashed or ellipse-like things. Add an extra named parameter
   'mx' to a CircleInvolute() constructor in the curve set data,
   which should be a four-element Python tuple giving a matrix (with
   the same semantics as the first four parameters of the
   six-element PostScript affine matrix). The involute will then be
   generated in the transformed coordinate system. For instance, the
   time-signature digit 8 uses this feature: its bulbs are somewhat
   oblate and ellipsoid, but they _would_ be basically circular (and
   hence match up well to the natural shapes of involute segments)
   if you squashed the x-axis by a factor of 3/4. Thus, the
   involutes that define that glyph are all defined with
   mx=(0.75,0,0,1).

Having drawn your curve set and pasted it into glyphs.py, you now
need to define the nib settings with which to draw along each curve.
This is done by assigning a 'nib' property to each curve; for
instance, if your curve set defines curves c0, c1 and c2, you would
set 'c0.nib', 'c1.nib' and 'c2.nib'. Nib settings can be any of:

 - A single number, indicating that every point on the specified
   curve should be surrounded by a circle of that radius. Equivalent
   to stroking along the line using the PostScript 'stroke'
   operator, with rounded line-cap and line-join settings, and with
   the PostScript line width set to twice the radius.

 - A tuple of four numbers specifying a chisel nib: (radius, angle,
   fdist, bdist). This nib type is rendered using a PostScript
   rounded-ended stroked straight line: the line width is twice
   'radius' (as above), it's slanted at angle 'angle', one end of it
   is 'fdist' away from the centre point in the given direction, and
   the other is 'bdist' away in the opposite direction. In other
   words, if the point on the original curve is (x,y), the nib at
   that point is generated by drawing a line from
   (x+fdist*cos(angle), y-fdist*sin(angle)) to (x-bdist*cos(angle),
   y+bdist*sin(angle)) and stroking it with thickness 2*radius.
   (Note that the signs of sin(angle) are flipped, because although
   y-coordinates run downwards rather than upwards, angles are still
   measured anticlockwise from the positive x-axis in standard
   mathematical convention. Also, they're in radians.)

 - A function (typically a Python lambda) which takes five arguments
   c,x,y,t,theta and returns one of the two forms above. This lets
   the nib vary along the length of the curve. The parameters are
   x,y (the current point on the curve), t (the value of whatever
   parameter is used to parametrise the curve - for Beziers this is
   their natural parametrisation, for involutes it runs from 0 to 1
   and is proportional to angle), theta (the current direction in
   which the curve is heading - as above, specified in radians
   anticlockwise from right), and c (the curve object itself, so you
   can retrieve any extra fields you assigned into it).

A few helper functions are provided for specialist nib types,
notably 'ptp_nib' which places one end of the chisel nib on the
curve and the other end wherever you like. You can use this to
arrange that the two ends of the nib follow independent curves; this
is used in many places, such as the top of the treble clef or the
thick part of a quaver tail.
